DOR("Definition of ready")
----------------------------------
 A backlog needs to be clear , testable and feasible:-
  User story is clear if all Scrum team members have a shared understanding of what it means.
  An item is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected . 
  A user story is feasible if it can be completed in one sprint
